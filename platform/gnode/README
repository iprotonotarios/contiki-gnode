This is a Contiki port for the G-Node G301 platform from SOWNet Technologies.
It is highly based on a port for the wsn430. This is to our best knowledge
due to Alexandre Boeglin <alexandre.boeglin@inria.fr>.

Some files in this folder shadow files from the contiki/core and
contiki/cpu folders. This is because the latter are not applicable to the
gnode. However remark that upstream changes are not automatically added
to these.

For instructions on how to upload applications to the nodes refer to 
apps/bulkupload.py. You might prefer to use directly the uploader provided
by SOWNet.

Beware that some files are not applicable and come directly from the wsn430
port. These should be cleaned.

Necessary improvements:
* xmem support. this will need a SW SPI implementation.
* automatic unique node id generation. typical platforms include a 
  serial number chip provider. gnode does not.
* button support.
* ...
